# This is a function that demonstrates how to use an octave rolloff filter in Praat
# This is useful for people who might be thrown off by the linear frequency-domain filtering in Praat
#
# To play: fiddle around with the 'cf' and 'rolloff.per.octave' parameters


cf = 4000
rolloff.per.octave = 5


# Here's an example of a sound filtered many times,
# to show different filter widths
  do ("Create Sound from formula...", "Noise", 1, 0, 0.5, 44100, "randomGauss(0,0.1)")

   for n from 3 to 8
	    filter_width = n*4
	    call filterOctaveRolloff Noise 'cf' 'filter_width' _'filter_width'
   endfor

# Here's the procedure
procedure filterOctaveRolloff .name$ .cf .rolloff.per.octave .suffix$
   select Sound '.name$'
   Filter (formula)...  if x > 1 then self*10^(-(abs((log10(x/.cf)/log10(2)))*.rolloff.per.octave)/20) else self fi
   Rename... '.name$''.suffix$'
